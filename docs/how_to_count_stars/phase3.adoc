== Phase III

Adding and checking YSOs with MIPS 24 micron photometry.

=== Initialize Data with `init`

Extract data with MIPS 24 micron detection with Ïƒ < 0.1 mag. 

[source, python]
----
def init(con, source):
    cur = con.cursor()
    target = source + '_p3'
    cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE '''+ target +''' AS SELECT 
                   desig, 
                   m3_6, m4_5, m5_8, m8_0, m24, 
                   c3624, c4524, c5824, c8024, c3658,
                   Type 
                   FROM '''+ source +''' WHERE
                   (m24 IS NOT NULL) AND
                   dm24 < 0.1 AND
                   (dm3_6 < 0.2 OR m3_6 IS NULL) AND
                   (dm4_5 < 0.2 OR m4_5 IS NULL) AND
                   (dm5_8 < 0.2 OR m5_8 IS NULL) AND
                   (dm8_0 < 0.2 OR m8_0 IS NULL)''')
    return target

=== Extract Transition Disks with `extract_3`

Sources that were considered photospheric (Class I or Class II) in Phase 1 or Phase 2 are identified as "transition disks" if they satisfy ONE of the following:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align*}
[5.8] - [24] &> 2.5 \\
[4.5] - [24] &> 2.5 \\
\end{align*}
++++

Also apply a distance-dependent brightness cutoff latexmath:[\zeta_{36}] to [3.6] to minimize inclusion of extragalactic contaminants:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align*}
[3.6] &< \zeta_{36}
\end{align*}
++++


[source, python]
----
def extract_3(con, source, cutoff36):
    #flag what were considered photospheric to transition disks
    cur = con.cursor()
    target = source + '_3'
    cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE '''+ target +''' AS SELECT
                   desig FROM '''+ source +''' WHERE 
                   (Type = 1 OR 2)AND 
                   (c5824 > 2.5 OR c4524 > 2.5)
                   AND m3_6 < ?
                   ''', [cutoff36])
    return target
----

=== Extract Class I*

Identify sources as deeply embedded protostar if they lack detections in some IRAC bands but satisfy BOTH of the following (bright MIPS photometry):

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align*}
[24] &< \zeta_{24} \\
[X] - [24] &> 4.5
\end{align*}
++++

where latexmath:[\zeta_{24}] is the distant-dependent brightness cutoff to mitigate extragalactic contamination and [X] is the photometry for the longest wavelength IRAC detection available in the catalog.

[source, python]
----
def extract_18(con, source, cutoff24):
    cur = con.cursor()
    target = source + '_18'
    cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE '''+ target + ''' AS 
                     SELECT desig FROM (SELECT desig, 
                      CASE
                      WHEN m8_0 IS NOT NULL THEN c8024
                      WHEN (m8_0 IS NULL) AND (m5_8 IS NOT NULL) THEN c5824
                      WHEN (m8_0 IS NULL) AND (m5_8 IS NULL) AND (m4_5 IS NOT NULL) THEN c4524
                      WHEN (m8_0 IS NULL) AND (m5_8 IS NULL) AND (m4_5 IS NULL) AND (m3_6 IS NOT NULL) THEN c3624
                      END AS cX_24
                     FROM ''' + source + ''' WHERE m24 < ?)
                    WHERE cX_24 > 4.5''', [cutoff24])
    return target
----

=== Reinclude Protostars (Class I)

Reinclude sources as protostars (Class I) that were previously identified as AGNs and shock emissions if they satisfy ALL of the following:
 
[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align*}
[24] &< \zeta_{24} \\
[3.6] - [5.8] &> 0.5 \\
[4.5] - [24] &> 4.5 \\
[8.0] - [24] &> 4
\end{align*}
++++

where latexmath:[\zeta_{24}] is a distance-dependent brightness cutoff for 24 micron to eliminate extragalactic contaminants. 

[source, python]

def reflag_299_to_1(con, source, cutoff24):
    cur = con.cursor()
    target = source + '_1_from_29_9'
    cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE '''+ target +''' AS SELECT desig FROM '''+ source +''' WHERE 
                   (Type = 29 OR Type = 9) AND 
                   m24 > ? AND
                   c3658 > 0.5 AND
                   c4524 > 4.5 AND
                   c8024 > 4''', [cutoff24])
    return target
----

=== Re-identify Protostars (Class I) as Class II

All previously identified protostars (Class I) that have 24 micron detections are identified as Class II if they satisfy EITHER of the following:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align*}
[5.8] - [24] &\leq 4; \text{ if possess 5.8 micron} \\
[4.5] - [24] &\leq 4; \text{ if do not possess 5.8 micron}
\end{align*}
++++

[source, python]
----
def reflag_1_to_2(con, source):
    cur = con.cursor()
    target = source+'_2_from_1'
    cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE '''+ target +''' AS SELECT desig FROM '''+source+''' WHERE 
                   Type = 1 AND 
                   (m5_8 IS NOT NULL AND c5824 <=4) OR
                   (m5_8 IS NULL AND c4524 <=4)''')
    return target

=== Run Phase 3

[source, python]

def run_phase3(master, constr, cutoff36, cutoff24):
    con = sql.connect(constr)
    cur = con.cursor()
    
    wc = init(con, master)
    cu.update_phase(con, master, wc, 0) <1>

    cu.update_type(con, master, c18, 1)

    cu.update_type(con, master, c2f1, 2)
    cu.update_type(con, wc, c2f1, 2)

<1> We follow Gutermuth's Phase labeling convention. Objects that are identified/updated in Phase III have value `0` in their `Phase` field.
<2> Reflagged sources are extracted into a new table and then used to update Type in the master table.

To use `run_phase3`, do

[source, python]

run_phase3('gtw49', '/home/kecai/w49/w49.db', 20, 20)
